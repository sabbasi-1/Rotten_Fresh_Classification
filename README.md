# Rotten_Fresh_Classification
In this project the task was to prepare the dataset we had of 18 classes (rotten and fresh fruits and vegies) using some image processing techniques that would help the model train better. Through experimentation I saw that the training only improved if we played around with contrast, brightness and the colors. Other techniques such as flipping and edge detection were also used but the training suffered. A simple CNN architecture was used to model the prepared dataset.
